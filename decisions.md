# Technical Decisions Log

## Architecture Decisions

1. Chrome Extension Structure
   - Using Manifest V3 for future compatibility
   - Background service worker for API communication
   - Popup UI for quick actions
   - Full-page options for detailed settings
   - Content script for Gmail integration

2. Frontend Framework
   - No heavy framework (React/Vue) to keep extension lightweight
   - Using vanilla JavaScript for better performance
   - Tailwind CSS for styling (bundled, not CDN)
   - Webpack for bundling and optimization

3. Backend Structure
   - Node.js with Express for API server
   - Separate service modules for Gmail and Claude
   - Winston for logging
   - Custom error handling middleware

4. Authentication
   - Google OAuth 2.0 for Gmail API
   - Token storage in Chrome extension storage
   - Automatic token refresh handling

5. Data Storage
   - Chrome storage sync for extension settings
   - Firebase Firestore for knowledge library
   - Local file system for logs

## UI/UX Decisions

1. Extension Popup
   - Compact design (384px width)
   - Real-time connection status indicator
   - Statistics dashboard with three categories
   - Two primary actions: Process Inbox and Generate Drafts
   - Visual feedback for all actions
   - Disabled state for offline/error conditions

2. Settings Page
   - Full-width design for better readability
   - Separate sections for different settings
   - Real-time saving
   - Form validation
   - Responsive layout

3. Error Handling
   - Visual feedback for all operations
   - Clear error messages
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation when offline

4. State Management
   - Centralized state in background worker
   - Event-based communication between components
   - Automatic state sync across views

## Development Decisions

1. Build System
   - Webpack for bundling
   - Separate bundles for popup and options
   - CSS extraction for better caching
   - Source maps for debugging
   - No code splitting to avoid duplication

2. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API communication
   - Manual testing for UI interactions
   - Automated build testing

3. Deployment Strategy
   - Development builds with source maps
   - Production builds with minimization
   - Automated version bumping
   - Chrome Web Store deployment

## Security Decisions

1. API Communication
   - HTTPS only
   - Token-based authentication
   - Request validation
   - Rate limiting

2. Data Storage
   - Encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure storage for tokens
   - Regular data cleanup

## Future Considerations

1. Performance Optimization
   - Lazy loading for options page
   - Caching for API responses
   - Background task queuing

2. Scalability
   - Modular architecture for easy updates
   - Extensible settings system
   - Pluggable categorization rules
